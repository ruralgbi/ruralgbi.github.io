Guaranteed Basic Income (GBI) is a policy that grants an unconditional cash grant to households or individuals, usually every month. It received attention recently as the main policy proposal of presidential primary candidate Andrew Yang. The 1968 Poor People’s Campaign proposed GBI for the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Economist Milton Friedman also advocated for GBI (1962, 1980). 

Basic economic theory predicts that guaranteeing a stable source of income might, on the one hand, decrease labor force participation: A recipient of such income increases their consumption of all goods, including leisure time. This prediction is the reason why GBI has political opposition. On the other hand, GBI potentially releases individuals from poverty traps—where the day-to-day struggle to meet immediate needs means that a single economic shock, like the Covid-19 PANDEMIC, can lead to job loss, eviction, bankruptcy, or reduced health. In a poverty trap, the long-term investments in skills and competency required to escape poverty are extremely risky. GBI can mitigate the investment risks and increase labor force participation in the long term. The opposing theoretical predictions of GBI’s outcomes make an empirical evaluation fundamental for understanding the policy. 

There are initial trials of GBI in urban areas of the US. Empirical work studying these trials is preliminary. In these settings, GBI is shown to reduce the variability of consumption, improve mental and physical health, and increase career-related investments such as internships, classes, and job hunting. There is no evidence of a disemployment effect. On the contrary, there is some evidence that, after a year of GBI, recipients are more likely to be employed than non-recipients (Marinescu, 2018; West et al., 2021). Poverty expands beyond urban areas in the US: 11.4 % of individuals in the US lived in poverty during 2020 (US Census Bureau, 2021). Of them, 67.5% resided in rural areas or outside principal cities. GBI could alleviate this poverty but its impact on this population is unknown. We aim to implement a social experiment for producing state-of-the-art evidence on the socioeconomic implications of GBI in the rural areas and small towns near Anderson, South Carolina.
