The project is based on a 24-month field randomized controlled trial of GBI in rural South Carolina. This project is a collaboration between Clemson University’s John E. Walker Department of Economics’ and Anderson Interfaith Ministries, a non-profit organization in Anderson, South Carolina
devoted to providing community services. Anderson Interfaith Ministries (hereinafter “AIM”) seeks to “connect people with support, resources, and education so they can empower themselves to become self-sufficient,” and conducts several programs specifically aimed at bolstering financial stability and
educational attainment within the Anderson community, including in some instances direct cash payments to individuals and families. AIM collaborated with us to be the experiment’s platform and identified 100 individuals
pooled from its current and past beneficiaries. As agreed to in the research design, AIM randomly assigned GBI to a subset of the 100 individuals (treatment group). The rest of the individuals
serve as a comparison group. Achieving a partnership with AIM required a complete description of the field experiment and its implementation. It also required developing tools for the planned semimonthly
collection of data on the participants’ economic outcomes.

AIM’s existing programs were used to identify potential participants and gather information on their employment status, educational attainment, and financial stability. AIM hosted the interviews described
below at their Anderson facility. Faculty, staff, and students from the John E. Walker Department of Economics conducted the interviews with program participants directly. To facilitate the program, a part-time program coordinator served as a bridge between the AIM programs
and participants and the Clemson research team. We worked with Spero Financial, a local credit union, to disburse the cash grants via reloadable debit cards. Debit card were provided to all individuals in the social experiment, independent of their treatment status. This provision was a service to all participants. Our preliminary research
indicated that most individuals with incomes below the federal poverty line have limited to no access to banking instruments. Providing individuals with a debit card was an additional implicit compensation for participating in our social experiment. The literature indicates that poor individuals have the desire
to save (Collins et al., 2009). When provided with instruments for doing so, they accumulate assets that allow them to buffer economic shocks, improving their well-being (Dupas and Robinson, 2013).

AIM provided the Clemson researchers with a preliminary list of potential participants of our social experiment. We contacted these individuals and explain to them our social experiment. We notified them that they are candidates to participate in a randomization protocol, assigning them to either the
treatment or control (comparison) group. Prior to randomizing them to either status, we required them to visit AIM for the baseline interviews. Individuals in the preliminary list who visited AIM for the baseline
interview were asked to sign an agreement to participate in our social experiment, to regularly participate in the quarterly follow-ups, and to return to AIM for the end-of-Phase interviews. With their
agreement to these conditions, they were be randomized to either treatment or control status.

In addition to the cash transfers, which vary across treatment and control status, we provided all participants a standard set of resources. These include access to benefit counseling, to understand the
consequences of participation on eligibility for other public benefits. They also included access to no-fee debit accounts, with an associated debit card, and all the personal finance planning resources that come with membership in a credit union.
